# Content Moderation System

Welcome to the **Content Moderation System** repository! 

# Introduction

In the digital age, content moderation is crucial to maintaining a safe and welcoming environment on platforms that host user-generated content. Our system leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models to detect and filter inappropriate content in both text and images.

# Features

- **Text Moderation**: Detects and filters harmful, abusive, or inappropriate text content using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
- **Image Moderation**: Identifies and flags images containing inappropriate content using deep learning models.
- **Dual Model Approach**: Separate models are used for text and image moderation, ensuring specialized and accurate detection.

# Model Training

### Text Moderation

The text moderation model was trained using a curated dataset containing labeled examples of inappropriate and appropriate text. The model architecture is based on [insert model details, e.g., BERT, LSTM, etc.], which provides robust performance in classifying text.

### Image Moderation

For image moderation, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on a dataset of labeled images. The model effectively identifies inappropriate content with high accuracy. Techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning were employed to enhance model performance.

# Usage

To use the content moderation system, follow these steps:

1. Run the moderation script:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Provide the input data (text or images) that you want to moderate.

3. The system will output a report indicating whether the content is appropriate or needs moderation.

# Results

The system has been tested on various datasets and has shown high accuracy in identifying inappropriate content. Here are some key metrics:

- **Text Moderation Accuracy**: 90%
- **Image Moderation Accuracy**: 92%
- **Precision**: 93%
- **Recall**: 93%
- **F1-Score**: 92%
